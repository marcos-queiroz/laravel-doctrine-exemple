Small Project Demonstrating the Use of Laravel Doctrine

## Description:
This project showcases the integration and usage of Laravel Doctrine, a package that allows seamless integration of the Doctrine ORM with Laravel applications. Laravel Doctrine provides a powerful and flexible way to manage database interactions, mapping entities to database tables, and executing database queries efficiently.

## Features:

### Entity Creation: 
Demonstrates how to create entities that represent database tables and their relationships.

### Repository Pattern: 
Implements the repository pattern to handle data access and abstracts away the underlying database logic.

### CRUD Operations: 
Illustrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using the Laravel Doctrine repository.

### Query Builder: 
Utilizes the Doctrine Query Builder to construct complex database queries and fetch data efficiently.

### Entity Manager: 
Utilizes the Doctrine Entity Manager to persist and update entities.

### Requirements:

PHP 7.4 or higher
Laravel 8.x
Laravel Doctrine 1.8.x


## Installation Steps:

Clone the project from the repository.
Install dependencies using Composer: 

```
    composer install
```

Create a new database and configure the database connection in the .env file.
Run migrations to create the required database tables: 

```
    php artisan migrate
``` 

Seed the database with sample data (optional):

```
    php artisan db:seed
```

## Usage:
The project provides several endpoints that demonstrate the usage of Laravel Doctrine features. These endpoints can be accessed through the web browser or API client like Postman.

### Endpoints:

POST /api/register: Creates a new user in the database.

POST /api/login: Authenticate user e generate token JWT.

### Endpoints restricted:

GET /api/user: Retrieves a specific user by authenticated.

GET /api/customers: Fetches all customers from the database.

GET /api/customers/{id}: Retrieves a specific customer by their ID.

POST /api/customers: Creates a new customer in the database.

PUT /api/customers/{id}: Updates an existing customer.

DELETE /api/customers/{id}: Deletes a customer from the database.


## Postman

Use the [Postman](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcos-queiroz/laravel-doctrine-exemple/main/test.postman_collection) file to run the tests.

Remember to change the {{base_url}} variable to your context.
